## :scroll: Description

This is my submission for Week 3 of the #AndroidDevChallenge 2021 and it implements this
[design](https://github.com/android/android-dev-challenge-compose/blob/assets/MySoothe.zip)

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

This project was fun to work with. The most exciting parts of this project for me was the 
styling and theming.

This project makes use of the following 3rd party libraries:

* Accompanist insets - for easy window inset manipulation
* Accompanist coil - for image loading

Further improvements will be:

* Add proper architecture - with ViewModel to get the data (even if it's still hardcoded)
* Add loading states
